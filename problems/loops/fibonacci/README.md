# Fibonacci

Write a program that reads a single number **N** from it's standart input stream and outputs the **N**-th fibonacci number. The fibonacci series are defined as follows in mathematical terms:

```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

## Input
A single line with a single natural number **N**.
**N** will never be greater than `50`.

## Output
A single line consisting of the **N**-th fibonacci number.
