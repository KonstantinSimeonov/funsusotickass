# Nearest primes

Write a program that reads a number **N** from stdin and outputs the smallest prime number **P1** that is greater than **N** and the largest number **P2** which is equal to or smaller than **N**.

## Input
- A single line containing a single natural number **N**.
- 2 <= **N** <= 500.

## Output
- Output the numbers **P1** and **P2** on a single line, separated by a single whitespace.

## Sample tests
